# Task Summary: Containerized UI Tests and Expanded CI/CD

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Containerized UI Tests**
   - Created Docker infrastructure for UI tests in `tests/ui/docker/`
   - Built custom Docker image with Playwright browsers pre-installed
   - Set up multi-stage docker-compose workflow (config validation → HA startup → onboarding → tests)
   - Replaced local UI test commands with Docker-based versions in Makefile

2. **Updated Test Suite**
   - Added UI tests back into `make test` command
   - All test types now run: unit, integration, E2E, and UI
   - Maintained parallel execution capabilities for performance

3. **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Renamed `e2e-tests.yml` to `all-tests.yml` to reflect broader scope
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to run complete test suite via `make test`
   - Kept same triggers (PR and push to main/master)
   - Added Python/UV setup for unit and integration tests
   - Increased timeout from 10 to 20 minutes for full test suite

## Key Features

- **Consistent Environment**: UI tests now run in same containerized environment as E2E tests
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run with pytest-xdist for speed
- **Multiple Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit available
- **Debug Modes**: Headed and debug modes for troubleshooting
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Containers cleaned before and after test runs
- **PR Comments**: Automatic test result comments on pull requests

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (unit, integration, E2E, UI)
make test

# Run just UI tests
make test:ui             # Headless mode
make test:ui:headed      # With visible browser
make test:ui:debug       # Debug mode with slowmo

# Setup for UI tests
make setup-ui            # Install UI test dependencies
make setup-all           # Install all test dependencies
```

## GitHub Actions

The workflow at `.github/workflows/all-tests.yml` now:
- Runs on every PR and push to main/master
- Executes the complete test suite
- Ensures all tests pass before allowing merge
- Uploads test results and logs as artifacts
- Comments on PRs with test status

## Test Organization

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast pure Python tests
│   ├── logic/      # Business logic tests
│   └── mock/       # Mock-based behavior tests
├── integration/    # Integration tests (no Docker)
├── e2e/           # End-to-end Docker tests
│   └── docker/    # E2E Docker configuration
└── ui/            # UI Playwright tests
    └── docker/    # UI Docker configuration
```

This setup ensures comprehensive test coverage with consistent environments across local development and CI/CD pipelines.
