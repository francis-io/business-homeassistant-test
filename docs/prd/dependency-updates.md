# Product Requirements Document: Automated Dependency Updates

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an automated dependency update system for the Home Assistant test framework. The goal is to ensure tests are always run against the latest stable versions of dependencies while maintaining reliability and providing clear visibility into version changes.

## Problem Statement

Currently, dependency versions can become outdated over time, potentially causing:
- Security vulnerabilities in outdated packages
- Compatibility issues with newer Home Assistant versions
- Missing out on performance improvements and bug fixes
- Tests passing locally but failing in production due to version mismatches

## Goals

1. **Automated Updates**: Regularly check and update dependencies to latest stable versions
2. **Safety First**: Ensure updates don't break existing functionality
3. **Visibility**: Clear reporting of what was updated and why
4. **Flexibility**: Allow pinning specific versions when needed
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with existing GitHub Actions

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Dependabot Integration (Recommended)
**Description**: Use GitHub's native Dependabot to automatically create PRs for dependency updates.

**Pros**:
- Native GitHub integration
- Automatic security vulnerability detection
- Configurable update frequency
- Creates individual PRs for each update
- Free for public repositories

**Cons**:
- Multiple PRs can be overwhelming
- Requires manual review and merge

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    groups:
      python-dependencies:
        patterns:
          - "*"
  
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/tests/e2e/docker"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

### Solution 2: Renovate Bot
**Description**: More powerful alternative to Dependabot with advanced configuration options.

**Pros**:
- Highly configurable
- Can group updates
- Supports more ecosystems
- Auto-merge capabilities

**Cons**:
- Requires bot installation
- More complex configuration
- May require paid plan for private repos

### Solution 3: Custom Update Script with UV
**Description**: Leverage UV's speed for custom dependency updates.

**Pros**:
- Full control over update process
- Can integrate with existing make commands
- Fast execution with UV
- Can update and test in one workflow

**Cons**:
- Requires maintenance
- Custom implementation needed

**Implementation Example**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# scripts/update_dependencies.py
import subprocess
import sys

def update_dependencies():
    """Update all dependencies to latest versions."""
    print("Updating dependencies with UV...")
    
    # Update all dependencies
    subprocess.run(["uv", "pip", "compile", "--upgrade", 
                   "pyproject.toml", "-o", "requirements.txt"])
    
    # Install updated dependencies
    subprocess.run(["uv", "pip", "sync", "requirements.txt"])
    
    # Run tests to verify
    result = subprocess.run(["make", "test"])
    
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print("Tests failed after update!")
        return 1
    
    print("All dependencies updated successfully!")
    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(update_dependencies())
```

### Solution 4: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for this project)
Combine multiple approaches for maximum effectiveness:

1. **Dependabot** for automated PR creation
2. **Custom make commands** for manual updates
3. **GitHub Actions** for automated testing
4. **Version pinning** for critical dependencies

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Automated Dependency Checking
- Check for updates weekly (configurable)
- Separate Python, Docker, and GitHub Action dependencies
- Group related updates to reduce PR noise

### 2. Update Process
- Create PR with detailed changelog
- Run full test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
- Generate compatibility report
- Allow auto-merge for patch versions (optional)

### 3. Version Management
- Support version pinning in pyproject.toml
- Allow version ranges for flexibility
- Maintain separate requirements files for different environments

### 4. Reporting
- Clear PR descriptions with:
  - What changed
  - Why it changed (security, features, etc.)
  - Breaking changes
  - Test results

### 5. Rollback Capability
- Easy rollback process if issues arise
- Version history tracking
- Git tags for stable versions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dependabot Setup (Week 1)
1. Create `.github/dependabot.yml`
2. Configure update rules
3. Set up PR labels and reviewers

### Phase 2: Make Commands (Week 1)
1. Add `make update-deps` command
2. Add `make check-deps` command
3. Update documentation

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration (Week 2)
1. Add dependency update workflow
2. Configure auto-merge rules
3. Set up notifications

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Week 2)
1. Test update process
2. Refine configuration
3. Document procedures

## Make Command Suggestions

```makefile
# Check for outdated dependencies
check-deps:
	@echo "Checking for outdated dependencies..."
	@uv pip list --outdated

# Update all dependencies to latest versions
update-deps:
	@echo "Updating all dependencies..."
	@uv pip compile --upgrade pyproject.toml -o requirements-new.txt
	@echo "Changes:"
	@diff requirements.txt requirements-new.txt || true
	@mv requirements-new.txt requirements.txt
	@uv pip sync requirements.txt
	@echo "Dependencies updated! Run 'make test' to verify."

# Update and test in one command
update-and-test: update-deps test
	@echo "Update and test completed!"

# Security audit
audit-deps:
	@echo "Running security audit..."
	@pip-audit || echo "Run 'make update-deps' to fix vulnerabilities"
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Update Frequency**: Dependencies updated at least monthly
2. **Test Coverage**: 100% of updates tested before merge
3. **Security**: Zero known vulnerabilities in dependencies
4. **Stability**: <5% of updates cause test failures
5. **Response Time**: Updates reviewed within 48 hours

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes | High | Comprehensive test suite, staged rollout |
| Update fatigue | Medium | Group updates, auto-merge patches |
| Version conflicts | Medium | Clear dependency resolution rules |
| CI/CD overhead | Low | Efficient caching, parallel testing |

## Recommendations

For this project, I recommend:

1. **Start with Dependabot** for automated PR creation
2. **Add make commands** for manual control
3. **Use UV** for fast dependency operations
4. **Implement the hybrid approach** for flexibility

This provides automation while maintaining control and visibility over the update process.
