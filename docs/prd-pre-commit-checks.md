# Product Requirements Document: Pre-Commit Checks for AI Code Quality

## Executive Summary
Implement pre-commit hooks to automatically enforce code quality standards on AI-generated code, ensuring consistent quality and preventing common issues before they enter the codebase.

## Problem Statement
As AI tools (like Claude) generate code, there's a need to automatically validate and enforce code quality standards before commits. This ensures:
- Consistent code formatting
- Type safety
- Linting compliance
- Test coverage maintenance
- Security best practices

## Goals
1. Prevent low-quality or non-compliant code from being committed
2. Provide immediate feedback on code quality issues
3. Automate code formatting and simple fixes
4. Maintain consistent standards across human and AI-generated code

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Code Formatting**
   - Python: black, isort
   - Automatic formatting on commit

2. **Static Analysis**
   - Python: flake8, mypy
   - Catch type errors and code style violations

3. **Security Scanning**
   - Detect hardcoded secrets
   - Check for common vulnerabilities

4. **Test Requirements**
   - Ensure tests pass before commit
   - Maintain minimum coverage thresholds

5. **Documentation**
   - Validate markdown formatting
   - Check for required documentation updates

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Checks complete within 30 seconds for typical commits
   - Only check modified files when possible

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear error messages
   - Easy to bypass for WIP commits (--no-verify)
   - Simple installation process

3. **Compatibility**
   - Works across different operating systems
   - Compatible with CI/CD pipeline

## Proposed Solution

### Tool Selection: pre-commit
- Language-agnostic with excellent Python support
- Rich ecosystem of hooks
- Automatic tool version management
- Well-documented and widely adopted

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Basic Setup (Week 1)
- Install pre-commit framework
- Configure basic Python hooks:
  - black (formatting)
  - isort (import sorting)
  - flake8 (linting)
  - mypy (type checking)

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Checks (Week 2)
- Add security scanning (detect-secrets)
- Add markdown linting
- Configure commit message validation
- Add YAML/JSON validation

#### Phase 3: Testing Integration (Week 3)
- Add test execution hooks
- Coverage threshold checks
- Performance optimizations

## Configuration Example
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 24.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: black

  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.13.0
    hooks:
      - id: isort

  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 7.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.8.0
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
        additional_dependencies: [types-all]
```

## Success Metrics
1. **Quality Metrics**
   - 0% commits with formatting issues
   - <5% commits rejected for quality issues
   - 100% type coverage on new code

2. **Developer Metrics**
   - <30 second average check time
   - <2% false positive rate
   - 90% developer satisfaction

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Risk**: Slow commit times
   - **Mitigation**: Use lint-staged for incremental checks

2. **Risk**: Developer frustration with strict checks
   - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, clear documentation, easy bypass

3. **Risk**: AI-generated code frequently fails checks
   - **Mitigation**: Configure AI tools with formatting rules, provide clear guidelines

## Timeline
- Week 1: Basic setup and testing
- Week 2: Enhanced checks and documentation
- Week 3: Testing integration and optimization
- Week 4: Team training and full rollout

## Dependencies
- Git repository
- Python development environment
- Team buy-in and training

## Open Questions
1. Should we enforce checks on all branches or just main/develop?
2. What should be the initial coverage threshold?
3. Should we auto-fix issues or just report them?
