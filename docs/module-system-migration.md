# Module System Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated from a flat command structure to a hierarchical module system using Just's `mod` feature. This provides better organization and allows commands to be naturally grouped.

## New Command Structure

### Module Hierarchy

```
just test                    # Run all tests (default behavior)
just test::help             # Show test module help
just test::unit             # Run all unit tests
just test::unit::help       # Show unit test help
just test::unit::logic      # Run logic tests only
just test::unit::mock       # Run mock tests only
just test::integration      # Run integration tests
just test::e2e             # Run E2E tests
just test::ui              # Run UI tests
just test::ui::headed       # Run UI tests with visible browser
just test::ui::debug        # Run UI tests in debug mode
just test::coverage         # Generate coverage report
just test::report          # Open coverage report
just test::quick           # Run quick tests (unit + integration)
just test::docker          # Run Docker-based tests
```

### Other Modules

- `just docker::`  - Container management
- `just python::`  - Environment management
- `just quality::` - Code quality tools
- `just dev::`     - Development utilities

## Key Features

1. **No `::all` needed** - Calling a module runs its default action

   - `just test` runs all tests
   - `just test::unit` runs all unit tests

1. **Help at every level** - Each module has its own help

   - `just test::help`
   - `just test::unit::help`
   - `just docker::help`

1. **Clean syntax** - Double colon (`::`) clearly shows module hierarchy

1. **Backward compatibility** - Old commands still work

   - `make test:unit` → `just test::unit`
   - `make test:integration` → `just test::integration`

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
justfile                 # Main entry point
just/
├── common.just         # Shared variables
├── test.just          # Test module
├── test/              # Test submodules
│   ├── unit.just
│   ├── integration.just
│   ├── e2e.just
│   └── ui.just
├── docker.just        # Docker module
├── python.just        # Python module
├── quality.just       # Quality module
└── dev.just          # Dev tools module
```

### Module Pattern

Each module:

1. Imports common variables
1. Has help as the first recipe (default action)
1. Contains related commands
1. Can have submodules

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Using Just directly (recommended for module commands)
just test                    # Run all tests
just test::unit             # Run unit tests
just test::unit::logic      # Run logic tests only
just docker::start          # Start containers
just python::setup          # Setup environment

# Using Make (for backward compatibility)
make test                   # Run all tests
make setup                  # Setup environment
make start                  # Start containers
make test:unit             # Old syntax still works
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization** - Commands are logically grouped
1. **Scalability** - Easy to add new modules or submodules
1. **Discoverability** - Help at each level shows available commands
1. **Clean Syntax** - Module hierarchy is clear from the command
1. **Flexibility** - Can be as specific or broad as needed

## Migration Notes

- The main `justfile` now uses `mod` instead of `import` for modules
- Each module must import its own variables (they're not shared automatically)
- The first recipe in a module is the default action
- Module names can't conflict with recipe names in the parent scope
